Justus told us about his new passion: the indie web! I loved this talk because before i started at FDND I learned some basic HTML and CSS on the indieweb. 
Justus told us about how he loved the web, but how it's changed from when he started using it. He
showed us some cool stuff he used to work with, stuff that he misses in today's web. Like how the
web is much less personal than ever. and how to fix that! 
Digital Gardens. The solution! It's simple: create your own corner on the web. It doesn't have to be
finished when you publish it, it just has to be yours. Een tuin is nooit af, elk seizoen is anders!
