Sanne gave a talk about the differences between study and work. She told us about her career, and how
she went from a bachelor in communication and multimedia design, to landing her dream job.
Sanne told us about the difference between agencies and big tech corporations, how their interview
process is different and how you can prepare for one. She also spoke about how you can figure out
what you actually want; what is important to you, do you prefer a big or small company, do you want
to work remote?
My biggest take away from this talk was that impostor syndrome is
normal. Everyone will experience
this at some point in their career. You don't have to be afraid to ask for help, no matter where you
are in your career.
